# The React App

A scalable, offline-first foundation for your next <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> project, with a focus on performance and best practices.

## What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in this project.

    .
    ├── public
    ├── src
    ├── node_modules
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .npmrc
    ├── codegen.yml
    ├── package.json
    ├── README.md
    ├── tsconfig.json
    └── yarn.lock

1.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site.

2.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

5.  **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

6.  **`tsconfig.json`**: A file that specifies the root files and the compiler options required to compile the project.

7.  **`package-lock.json / yarn.lock`** (See `package.json` above, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
